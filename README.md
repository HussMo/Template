Question 1:
"If you are deploying an iOS app to a store that accepts payments through third-party integrations, but
it's not compatible with Apple Pay, and your app gets rejected by apple review because you were advised
to add Apple Pay into your app. However, Apple Pay is not available in Egypt. Someone recommends that
you remove your app from stores availability from countries that have Apple Pay in order to gain
approval. How would you address this challenge?"

Answer:

-The best solution here is to consider Alternative Payment Systems, Instead of removing the app from certain regions, consider integrating other payment systems that are widely accepted and supported in those regions like Egypt. we could integrate with local payment gateways or other digital wallets.

Question 2:
"Could you provide an overview of how IPA files play a crucial role in supporting the app development
lifecycle, from initial testing to final distribution? Additionally, based on your experience, have you ever
been required to generate an IPA file for your app, and if so, what was the context and purpose behind
it?"

 Answer:

1- During the development phase, we are creating an IPA file to test the application. This file contains the application's compiled code, resources, and manifest files. We can use this file to test the application on iOS devices or simulators before submitting it to the App Store.


2- After testing, we create a final IPA file for distribution. This file is uploaded to the App Store via App Store Connect. The App Store uses this file to create the binary that will be distributed to users.


3- Once the IPA file is uploaded, it enters the App Store's review process. Apple's team reviews the app for compliance with their guidelines. Any issues found during this process will be communicated back to the developer.


4- After a successful review, the app is published on the App Store. Users can then download and install the IPA file from the App Store onto their devices.
